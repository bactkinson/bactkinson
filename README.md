### Hey

My name is Blake, and I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Rice University in the Civil and Environmental Engineering department. My work is at the intersection of data and air quality. Specifically, I'm developing new statistical methods to analyze air pollution measurements taken on a mobile platform. These mobile platforms can include bicycles, trains, cars, and even yourself! The measurements taken with these platforms present a lot of challenges when it comes to analysis because they have properties that vary with both space and time.

Hope you take the time to look around a little bit. If you're specifically working with mobile monitoring time series, I hope you take the chance to check out the SIBaR_Background_Removal_and_Quantification repository, which contains R code for implementing State Informed Background Removal, or SIBaR for short. It's an algorithm that takes a different look at estimating background in mobile monitoring time series by using Hidden Markov models. 

Thanks for reading this short little blurb. You're awesome.
